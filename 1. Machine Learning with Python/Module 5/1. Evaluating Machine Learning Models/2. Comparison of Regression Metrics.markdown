| Metric | What It Measures | Units | Strengths | Weaknesses | When to Use | Simple Math |
|--------|------------------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | Average size of mistakes (how far off predictions are) | Same as data (e.g., points for grades) | Easy to understand (e.g., off by 3 points), treats all mistakes equally | Ignores big mistakes’ impact (e.g., a 20-point error counts the same as a 2-point error) | When you want a simple error average and big mistakes aren’t critical | 1. Error = Predicted - Actual (make positive)<br>2. Total Error = Error1 + Error2 + ...<br>3. MAE = Total Error / Number of Predictions |
| MSE (Mean Squared Error) | Average of squared mistakes (big mistakes count more) | Squared units (e.g., points² for grades) | Notices big mistakes more, used in model training | Hard to understand (squared units), very sensitive to big mistakes | When big mistakes are a big deal (e.g., safety systems) or for training models | 1. Error = Predicted - Actual<br>2. Squared Error = Error * Error<br>3. Total = Squared Error1 + Squared Error2 + ...<br>4. MSE = Total / Number of Predictions |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | Square root of MSE (like MSE but in normal units) | Same as data (e.g., points for grades) | Easy to understand (e.g., off by 3.3 points), notices big mistakes | Still sensitive to big mistakes (outliers can skew it) | When you want MSE’s focus on big mistakes but need clear units | 1. Calculate MSE<br>2. RMSE = Square Root of MSE |
| R-squared | How much of data’s ups and downs the model explains | No units (0 to 1, like a percentage) | Easy to explain (e.g., 85% of grade changes explained), shows model fit | Assumes linear data, doesn’t show error size | To show how well the model fits, especially to non-technical people | 1. Average = (Actual1 + Actual2 + ...) / Number of Predictions<br>2. Total Variation = Sum of (Actual - Average) * (Actual - Average)<br>3. Unexplained = Sum of (Predicted - Actual) * (Predicted - Actual)<br>4. R-squared = 1 - (Unexplained / Total Variation) |
