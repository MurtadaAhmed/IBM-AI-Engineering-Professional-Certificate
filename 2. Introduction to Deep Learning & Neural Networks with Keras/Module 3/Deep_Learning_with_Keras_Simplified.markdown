## Regression Models with Keras

### What is a Regression Model?

- **Definition**: A **regression model** predicts **continuous numerical values** (e.g., house prices, temperatures) using a neural network.
- **Clarification**:
  - **Continuous**: Numbers with decimals (e.g., 79.99 vs. categories like “high/low”).
  - It’s like guessing someone’s exact height based on their age and weight.
- **Example**: Predicting the **compressive strength** of concrete (in megapascals) based on ingredients (cement, water, etc.).

### Building a Regression Model with Keras

- **Dataset Example**: Concrete strength dataset (pandas DataFrame `concrete_data`):
  - **Features (Predictors)**: 8 columns (e.g., cement: 540 m³, water: 162 m³).
  - **Target**: Compressive strength (e.g., 79.99 MPa for a 28-day-old mix).
- **Neural Network Design**:
  - **Input Layer**: 8 nodes (one per feature).
  - **Hidden Layers**: Two layers, each with 5 nodes (small for simplicity; typically 50–100).
  - **Output Layer**: 1 node (predicts strength).
  - **Dense Network**: Every node in one layer connects to all nodes in the next.
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Split DataFrame into:
    - **Predictors**: DataFrame with 8 feature columns.
    - **Target**: DataFrame with strength column.
  - Ensures data is in the right format for Keras.
- **Keras Code Steps**:
  1. **Import Libraries**:
     - `from keras.models import Sequential`: For linear stack of layers.
     - `from keras.layers import Dense`: For fully connected layers.
  2. **Create Model**:
     - `model = Sequential()`: Initialize a sequential model (common for most networks).
  3. **Add Layers**:
     - First hidden layer: `model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)))`
       - 5 neurons, **ReLU** activation (recommended for hidden layers, avoids vanishing gradient).
       - `input_shape=(8,)`: Matches 8 predictors.
     - Second hidden layer: `model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu'))`
       - No `input_shape` (inherits from previous layer).
     - Output layer: `model.add(Dense(1))`
       - 1 neuron, no activation (linear output for regression).
  4. **Compile Model**:
     - `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')`
       - **Adam Optimizer**: Efficient alternative to gradient descent, auto-tunes learning rate.
       - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Loss measure (difference between predicted and true values squared).
  5. **Train Model**:
     - `model.fit(predictors, target)`
       - Trains using predictors and target data.
       - Optional: Specify `epochs` (training iterations, e.g., 100).
  6. **Make Predictions**:
     - `predictions = model.predict(new_data)`
       - Outputs predicted strengths for new concrete samples.
- **Why It’s Simple**:
  - Keras builds and trains this model with ~10 lines of code.
  - Abstracts complex math (e.g., backpropagation, optimization).
- **Example**: Input a new concrete mix (e.g., 500 m³ cement, 150 m³ water), and Keras predicts its strength (e.g., 75 MPa).
- **Clarification**: Building a regression model with Keras is like using a calculator to predict a number, inputting data (features), and getting a result (prediction) with minimal effort.

## Classification Models with Keras

### What is a Classification Model?

- **Definition**: A **classification model** predicts **discrete categories** (e.g., spam/not spam, good/bad) using a neural network.
- **Clarification**:
  - **Discrete**: Labels or classes (e.g., 0 = bad, 1 = good vs. numbers like 79.99).
  - It’s like deciding if a movie is “good” or “bad” based on its rating and genre.
- **Example**: Predicting whether buying a car is a **good choice** (0 = bad, 1 = acceptable, 2 = good, 3 = very good) based on price, maintenance cost, and capacity.

### Building a Classification Model with Keras

- **Dataset Example**: Car purchase dataset (`car_data`):
  - **Features (Predictors)**: 8 columns after **one-hot encoding**:
    - Price: High, medium, low (3 columns).
    - Maintenance: High, medium, low (3 columns).
    - Capacity: Two or more people (2 columns).
  - **Target**: Decision (0 = bad, 1 = acceptable, 2 = good, 3 = very good).
  - Example: Car 1 (high price, high maintenance, two people) → Decision 0 (bad).
- **Neural Network Design**:
  - Same as regression: 8 input nodes, two hidden layers (5 nodes each), but **output layer has 4 nodes** (one per class).
  - Uses **softmax** in output layer to output probabilities summing to 1.
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Split into **predictors** (8 feature columns) and **target** (decision column).
  - Transform target into **one-hot encoded array** using `to_categorical`:
    - Example: Decision 0 → [1, 0, 0, 0], Decision 1 → [0, 1, 0, 0].
    - Ensures model outputs probabilities for each class.
- **Keras Code Steps**:
  1. **Import Libraries**:
     - `from keras.models import Sequential`
     - `from keras.layers import Dense`
     - `from keras.utils import to_categorical`: For one-hot encoding target.
  2. **Prepare Target**:
     - `target = to_categorical(target)`: Converts target column to binary array.
  3. **Create Model**:
     - `model = Sequential()`
  4. **Add Layers**:
     - First hidden layer: `model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(8,)))`
     - Second hidden layer: `model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu'))`
     - Output layer: `model.add(Dense(4, activation='softmax'))`
       - 4 neurons (one per class), **softmax** ensures probabilities sum to 1.
  5. **Compile Model**:
     - `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])`
       - **Categorical Crossentropy**: Loss measure for multi-class classification.
       - **Accuracy**: Tracks percentage of correct predictions.
  6. **Train Model**:
     - `model.fit(predictors, target, epochs=100)`
       - Specifies **epochs** (e.g., 100 iterations) for training.
  7. **Make Predictions**:
     - `predictions = model.predict(new_data)`
       - Outputs probabilities for each class (e.g., [0.99, 0.01, 0, 0] → Decision 0).
- **Interpreting Output**:
  - For each input, model outputs 4 probabilities (sum = 1).
  - Highest probability indicates predicted class.
  - Example: [0.99, 0.01, 0, 0] → Decision 0 (bad, 99% confident).
  - Close probabilities (e.g., [0.51, 0.49, 0, 0]) show lower confidence.
- **Why It’s Simple**:
  - Similar code structure to regression, with tweaks for classification (softmax, crossentropy, to_categorical).
  - Keras handles complex math (e.g., probability calculations).
- **Example**: Input a car (medium price, low maintenance, more than two people), and Keras predicts [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.05] → Decision 1 (acceptable, 80% confident).
- **Clarification**: Building a classification model with Keras is like using a quiz to pick the best answer (class), with scores (probabilities) showing confidence.
